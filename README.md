Hi everyone!

Gilberto here. I am a Digital Design professor and I love to study technology tools. I have worked with web since 90s and I started study it as a researcher in 2003. Since them I have studied each new thing that could enhance user experience on Internet systems. I know just a little about web development as a front-end design. I know html and css but now I want to start studying javaScript and after that start coding java.

Thank for read me!

Gilberto
